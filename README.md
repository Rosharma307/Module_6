Seoul Bike Rental Analysis Documentation

This document provides an overview of the analysis and modeling performed on the Seoul Bike Rental dataset. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, perform regression analysis to predict bike rental counts, and visualize relevant insights.

Data Exploration and Analysis
- The dataset contains information about bike rentals in Seoul, including various features such as date, temperature, humidity, and more.
- Data exploration involved examining data summary statistics, visualizing data distributions, and understanding temporal trends in bike rentals.
- Key findings include identifying the most popular room type, top booking agent, and visitor countries. The analysis also highlighted differences between City and Resort Hotels in terms of booking rates and customer preferences.

 Data Preprocessing
- Data preprocessing steps included converting date columns to datetime objects and creating new features like year, month, day of the week, and hour of the day.
- Handling missing values and visualizing outliers through box plots were essential data preparation steps.
- Feature selection was based on correlation analysis and feature importance from an XGBoost model.

Regression Analysis
- Regression analysis was performed to predict bike rental counts.
- Initially, an XGBoost model was trained and evaluated, providing baseline performance metrics.
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed using a grid search approach to optimize the model's hyperparameters.

Hyperparameter Tuning
- Grid search was employed to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the XGBoost model.
- The tuned model showed improved performance in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Visualization
- Visualizations were created to provide insights into various aspects of the data, including:
  - Monthly trends in bike rentals.
  - Weekly patterns in rentals.
  - Correlation between features.
  - Feature importance.
  - Predicted vs. actual rental counts.

 Conclusion
- The analysis uncovered valuable insights into bike rentals in Seoul, including factors influencing rentals, seasonal trends, and feature importance.
- The optimized XGBoost model demonstrated its predictive capabilities for bike rental counts.
- This documentation summarizes the steps taken in the analysis and provides a clear overview of the project's findings and results.
